This Pine Script calculates the Kairi Relative Index (KRI) and plots buy/sell signals on the chart. 

## How it works ‚öôÔ∏è

The script calculates the KRI as follows:

```
KRI = 100 * (Source - SMA) / SMA
```

where:

*   `Source` is the price source (e.g., close price).
*   `SMA` is the Simple Moving Average of the source price.

Buy signals are plotted when the KRI crosses above zero üü¢, and sell signals are plotted when the KRI crosses below zero üî¥.

## Usage üíª

1.  Add the script to your TradingView chart.
2.  Adjust the `Length` input to control the period of the Simple Moving Average.
3.  Adjust the `Source` input to select the price source.
